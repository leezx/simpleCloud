# common cell types/lines you must known

## whole blood / Peripheral blood
erythrocytes (red blood cells), leukocytes (white blood cells), and thrombocytes (platelets), suspended in blood plasma.

## LCL / Lymphoblastoid Cell lines
LCLs are developed by infecting peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) with Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) which has been demonstrated to immortalize human resting B cells in vitro giving rise to an actively proliferating B cell population (1).

## PBMC / Peripheral blood mononuclear cell
A peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) is any peripheral blood cell having a round nucleus.[1] These cells consist of lymphocytes (T cells, B cells, NK cells) and monocytes, whereas erythrocytes and platelets have no nuclei, and granulocytes (neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils) have multi-lobed nuclei. In humans, lymphocytes make up the majority of the PBMC population, followed by monocytes, and only a small percentage of dendritic cells.
